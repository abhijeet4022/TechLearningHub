# The Story of Linux OS: Breaking Free from Hardware Boundaries.
* In the early days of computing, operating systems (OS) were often tied to the hardware they ran on. One of the most influential early OSs was UNIX, developed in the 1970s. While UNIX was powerful and became popular in large organizations, it had a significant drawback-it was proprietary and expensive. Different vendors, like AT&T and IBM, created their own versions of UNIX that only ran on their specific hardware, creating a closed system.

* This hardware-software lock-in was costly setups for smaller organizations. As a result, there was a growing need for a more accessible and flexible alternative.

# The GNU Project: Richard Stallman's Quest for Software Freedom
* Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project in 1983. His goal was to create a free operating system that wasn't restricted to specific hardware, giving users the freedom to use, modify, and share software. He successfully built many of the essential tools and utilities, but he didn't have the crucial piece: the kernel-, which is the core part of an OS that manages hardware resources and allows software to run.

# Linus Torvalds: Building the Linux Kernel
* In 1991, a Finnish university student named Linus Torvalds started working on a personal project to build a Unix-like kernel that could run on regular, inexpensive hardware. On August 25, 1991, he announced the creation of the Linux kernel.

* While the Linux kernel was functional, it needed other tools to become a complete OS. Torvalds' work combined with Stallman's GNU tools to create the first fully functional, free operating system: GNU/Linux.

# The Rise of Linux in the Server World
* The combination of GNU tools and the Linux kernel created a robust, free, and open-source operating system that quickly gained popularity, especially in the server world. As organizations sought to reduce the costs associated with proprietary systems, Linux emerged as an ideal solution.

* Today, Linux powers a significant portion of servers worldwide, becoming the backbone of many cloud services, data centers, and enterprise applications. Its flexibility, stability, and strong community support have made it the preferred choice for businesses of all sizes.

* One of the major contributors to the rise of Linux in the enterprise world was Red Hat, founded in 1993. Red Hat took the Linux kernel, built a stable and supported version of the operating system known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and offered it as a commercial product with support services. Since Red Hat used the Linux kernel, which is open source, they were obligated to release the source code. However, RHEL itself is not free, as the cost of the OS includes access to Red Hat's support and updates.

* Today, Red Hat is one of the leading companies in the Linux ecosystem, contributing extensively to the development of the Linux kernel and other open-source technologies. Other major distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS have also become popular in various sectors, but Red Hat remains a dominant player in the enterprise market.
