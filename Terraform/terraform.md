* Which Terraform command will check and report errors within modules, attribute names, and value types to ensure they are syntactically valid and internally consistent?
* `terraform validate`

* A user runs terraform init on their RHEL-based server, and per the output, two provider plugins are downloaded:
* `.terraform/plugins`

* Which VCS terraform supports
Git, Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket,  GitHub.com

* Which VCS does not terraform support?
* CVS Version control System

* `depends_on` create explicit dependency on resources.

* We can publish the value from any module using output block and retrieve the values using module.subnet.subnet_id

* How to change the local name of any resources without deleting the object.
* terraform state mv aws_instance.<old name> aws_instance.<new name>

* The provider plugins are downloaded and stored in the `.terraform/providers` directory. 

*  default parallelism value for terraform apply is "10".

* float is not correct data types in terraform.

* terraform starts indexing from 0 in count and for_each.

* Terraform does not not support AIX OS.

* Terraform Community (Free) stores the local state for workspaces in a directory called `terraform.tfstate.d/`. This directory structure allows for separate state files for each workspace, making it easier to manage and maintain the state data.

* The correct prefix string for setting input variables using environment variables in Terraform is TF_VAR. Terraform recognizes this prefix to assign values to variables.

* The "GitHub" is not a supported backend type in Terraform. Terraform does not have built-in support for storing state in a GitHub repository.

* Running `terraform init` is necessary when a new provider is introduced to download the required plugin. This ensures that Terraform has access to the Infobox provider and can properly manage the DNS record resource.

* `.terraform.lock.hcl` will keep the info about Provider Name and Version. 

* After approving a merge request, Terraform Cloud will run a speculative plan to show the potential changes that will be applied to the managed environment. This allows users to review and validate the changes against any applicable Sentinel policies before applying them.

* The statement is true because the `terraform plan -refresh-only` command is specifically designed to only refresh the Terraform state to match any changes made to remote objects outside Terraform. It does not apply those changes to the state.

* Using `terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.web` allows Emma to mark the specific virtual machine resource for replacement without affecting other resources that were created. This command is useful for quickly recreating a single resource.

* Each Terraform workspace uses its own state file to manage the infrastructure associated with that particular workspace.

* The `terraform get` command is used to download modules from the module registry or a version control system, making them available for use in the configuration.

* The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It downloads any modules specified in the configuration.

* The private registry feature in Terraform Cloud allows users to publish and maintain custom modules within their organization, providing a secure and controlled environment for sharing infrastructure configurations.

* The correct additional parameter required to use multiple provider blocks of the same type with distinct configurations is the "alias" parameter. This allows you to differentiate between the different configurations of the same provider type.

Q. In Terraform, most resource dependencies are handled automatically. Which of the following statements best describes how Terraform resource dependencies are handled? 
A. Terraform analyzes any expressions within a resource block to find references to other objects and treats those references as implicit ordering requirements when creating, updating, or destroying resources.

However, two other team members, Michael and Chucky, are using a Cloud SQL instance for testing and request to keep it running.

How can Freddy and Jason destroy all other resources without negatively impacting the database?
A. run a `terraform state` rm command to remove the Cloud SQL instance from Terraform management before running the `terraform destroy` command.

Q. The terraform plan -refresh-only command is used to create a plan whose goal is only to update the Terraform state to match any changes made to remote objects outside of Terraform.
A. The statement is true because the terraform plan -refresh-only command is specifically designed to only refresh the Terraform state to match any changes made to remote objects outside of Terraform. It does not apply those changes to the state.

A. invalid â€” Because this is not reserve word in terraform.

Q. What tasks can the terraform state command be used for in Terraform?
A. modify the current state, such as removing items.

Q. After many years of using Terraform Community (Free), you decide to migrate to Terraform Cloud. After the initial configuration, you create a workspace and migrate your existing state and configuration. What Terraform version would the new workspace be configured to use after the migration?
A. The new workspace in Terraform Cloud will be configured to use the same Terraform version that was used to perform the migration. This ensures compatibility and consistency with the existing state and configuration.

Q. Why might users want to utilize Sentinel or OPA with Terraform Cloud in their infrastructure workflow?
A. 
* Sentinel and OPA can enhance security by preventing unauthorized changes to your managed infrastructure.
* Organizations can enforce resource naming conventions or approved machine images for improved consistency and clarity
* Sentinel and OPA enable automated policy checks to enforce compliance standards before applying changes to production environments
* To provide real-time feedback on potential security risks in Terraform configurations during the development process
