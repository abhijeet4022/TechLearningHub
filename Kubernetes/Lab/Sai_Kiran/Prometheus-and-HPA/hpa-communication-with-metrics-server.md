# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Communication with Metrics Server

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes communicates with the **Metrics Server** via the **Kubernetes API server**. Here's how the interaction works:

## Key Components:
1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: It is responsible for scaling the pods based on the metrics (CPU, memory, or custom metrics).
2. **Metrics Server**: Collects resource metrics (such as CPU and memory usage) from the kubelets on each node in the cluster and exposes them to the Kubernetes API server.

## How HPA Communicates with the Metrics Server:

### 1. Metrics Server Collection:
- The **Metrics Server** collects metrics from each node's **kubelet**. The kubelet exposes these metrics via the `/metrics/cadvisor` endpoint.
- The **Metrics Server** collects these metrics periodically (usually every 60 seconds).
- It then aggregates and exposes the resource usage metrics for nodes and pods through the Kubernetes API.

### 2. HPA Metric Query:
- The **HPA** queries the **Kubernetes API server** for metrics, such as CPU or memory utilization, based on the configuration in the HPA object.
- The **HPA** uses the Kubernetes **Metrics API** (`/apis/metrics.k8s.io`) to request resource usage metrics.
- The **API server**, in turn, fetches the metrics from the **Metrics Server**.

### 3. HPA Metrics Evaluation:
- Once the **HPA** receives the metrics, it compares them with the target values defined in the HPA spec (e.g., target CPU utilization).
- If the current utilization exceeds or falls below the target threshold, the **HPA** adjusts the replica count of the deployment accordingly.

### 4. Metrics Server Response:
- The **Metrics Server** responds with the metrics in the form of **JSON** data (typically via the `/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods` endpoint).
- The **HPA** uses these metrics to decide whether to scale the application or not.

## Communication Flow Example:
1. **Metrics Server** collects data from **kubelets** about resource utilization on nodes and pods.
2. **HPA** sends a request to the **Kubernetes API server** asking for the current CPU and memory metrics of the pods (for example).
3. The **API server** queries the **Metrics Server** and retrieves the latest metrics data.
4. The **API server** returns the metrics to the **HPA**.
5. The **HPA** evaluates the metrics against the configured target (e.g., 50% CPU utilization).
6. Based on the evaluation, the **HPA** adjusts the replica count of the target deployment.

## Example of Metrics API Request:
When **HPA** queries the metrics API for CPU utilization, it uses the following path:
```bash
GET /apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{pod-name}
```
