## This is helpful if we do not define the quota on resource level also user cannot define the unwanted minimum quota on deployment if mentioning.

Two types of quota:
1. Compute Quota
   1. Deployment label
      1. Request Quota (Minimum Requirement)
      2. Limits quota (Maximum Can be used)
   2. NameSpace label 
      1. Limit range
2. Resource Quota
