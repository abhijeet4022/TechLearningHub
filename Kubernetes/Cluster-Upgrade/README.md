# Kubernetes Release Cycle

Kubernetes releases a minor version every 3-4 months (e.g., 1.27, 1.28).

AWS EKS only supports three Kubernetes versions:
- Current version (e.g., 1.28)
- Two prior versions (e.g., 1.26, 1.27)

Stay updated with release notes on the Kubernetes website and AWS EKS documentation.

# Best Practices

## Staging Environment

Test the upgrade in a staging or pre-prod environment before upgrading production.

## Rollbacks

Have a rollback plan in case of failure. This includes:
- Snapshots of EBS volumes
- Database backups
- Configuration exports

## Use Managed Nodegroups

Managed nodegroups simplify upgrades and ensure compatibility.

# Important Notes

Amazon EKS does not support downgrading the cluster version once it has been upgraded. Once the Kubernetes control plane is upgraded to a higher version, you cannot roll back to a previous version. This restriction applies to both the EKS control plane and nodegroups.

However, if you face issues after an upgrade, there are mitigation strategies and best practices to address the situation:

# Mitigation Strategies After Upgrade Issues

## Restore from Backup

Before upgrading, you should always back up critical resources, including:
- Application manifests and configurations:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all --all-namespaces -o yaml
  ```
- Persistent Volumes (if using non-ephemeral storage)
- Database backups (for stateful applications)

If an issue arises, you can delete the problematic cluster and recreate it using the backup.

## Create a New Cluster with the Previous Version

If the upgraded cluster is unstable, you can:
1. Create a new EKS cluster with the previous Kubernetes version.
2. Migrate workloads to the new cluster by reapplying configurations and restoring data.

Use tools like Velero to backup and restore Kubernetes resources:

```bash
velero backup create <backup_name> --include-namespaces <namespace>
velero restore create <restore_name> --from-backup <backup_name>
```

## Rollback Nodegroups

While you cannot downgrade the control plane, you can revert nodegroups to an earlier version (if using self-managed nodes or custom AMIs):
- Terminate upgraded nodes and recreate a nodegroup using the old AMI and Kubernetes version.

This is only a temporary measure, as nodes running an older version might eventually cause compatibility issues with the newer control plane.
