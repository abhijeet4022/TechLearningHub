If we want AI to make a real difference, it starts with picking the right first project. Not every process is for AI. The best early use cases tend to have three things in common:

1. **They're well-documented**
2. **Highly routine**
3. **Rich in data**

## Identify AI Use Cases for Immediate Impact

### 1. Documentation
If the process is fuzzy, driven by intuition, or handled differently across the team, AI is going to struggle. Where workflows are clearly mapped, decisions are recorded, and procedures are standardized, AI can learn from what's already there. For example, HR can use AI to screen job applications. If there was no consistency in how offers had been made, and no clean records of decision criteria, AI will fail to do the job. But once they cleaned up the hiring records and aligned on a process, AI started surfacing stronger candidates and saved plenty of time.

### 2. Routine
AI is really good at finding patterns, but that only works when the work itself is predictable. Think repetitive tasks with clear rules and limited variation. Felix, a VP of operations at a regional hospital system, identified one such task: verifying patient insurance eligibility. It was manual, time-consuming, and followed the same steps every time. They introduced AI to automate the check and flag exceptions, and within two months, turnaround time had dropped by 40% and billing errors had decreased significantly. That wasn't an innovation moonshot—it was strategic housekeeping that delivered fast results.

### 3. Data
AI learns by example. If you don't have enough data or if it's scattered, incomplete, or siloed, the outputs are going to be unreliable. That was the initial problem for Thomas, who ran fleet operations for a logistics company. He wanted to use AI to predict vehicle breakdowns, but their maintenance records were sparse and inconsistent. Instead of shelving the idea, he focused on improving data capture, standardizing forms, centralizing records, and logging more details. Within six months, the same AI model was delivering actionable alerts, and downtime dropped by 15%. Leaders often want to start with the biggest, flashiest AI use cases, but the better move is to start where success is most likely. Look for processes that are already well-structured, repetitive, and data-driven. That's where AI can prove its value quickly and where you'll earn the most internal trust to go further.
