If we want AI to make real difference it starts with picking the right first project. Not every process is for AI the best early use cases tend to have three thins in common:
1. They're will-documented
2. highly routine
3. and rich in data.


## Identify AI Use cases for Immediate Impact
1. Documentation
* If the process is fuzzy, driven by intuition, handled differently across team AI is going to struggle. Where workflows are clearly mapped, decisions are recorded and procedures are standardized, AI can learn from what's already there. Like HR use AI for screen job applications so if there was no consistency in how offers had been made, and no clean records of decision criteria AI will fail to do the job. But once they cleaned up the hiring records, and aligned on a process, AI will start surfacing stronger candidates and can save planty of time.


2. Routine
* AI is really good to finding the patterns but that only works when the work itself is predictable. Think repetitive tasks with clear rules, and limited variation. Felix, who's a VP of operations at a regional hospital system, identified one such task: Verifying patient insurance eligibility, it was manual, time-consuming, and follow the same steps every time. They introduced AI to automate the check and flag exceptions, and within two months, turnaround time had dropped by 40% and billing errors had decreased significantly. That wasn't an innovation moonshot. It was strategic housekeeping that delivered fast results.

3. Data
* AI learns by example, if you don't have enough data or if it's scattered, incomplete or siloed, the outputs are going to be unreliable. That was the initial problem for thomas who ran fleet operations for a logistics company. He wanted to use AI to predict vehicle breakdowns, but their maintenance records were sparse and inconsistent. Instead of shelving the idea, he focused on improving data capture, standardizing forms, centralizing records, and logging more details. Within six months same AI model was delivering actionable alerts, and downtime dropped by 15%. Leaders often want to start with the biggest, flashiest AI use cases, but the better move is to start where success is most likely. Look for processes that are already well-structured,  repetitive, and data-driven. That's where AI can prove its value quickly and where you'll earn the most internal trust to go further.
