- Telling an AI system to go step by step improves its output, or you can improve it even more by also telling it to take a deep breath. Yes, that doesn't make any sense. Actually it does, but it doesn't sound like it makes any sense because this is software running on a computer. It's not breathing and it's also not thinking it's a language machine. So let me show you first and then I'll explain what's going on afterwards. Here I have a prompt. This is another logic puzzle. It says 48 people are riding a bus, on the first stop, eight passengers get off. This is a standard logic puzzle, so we'll run it and see what the system does. Notice how ChatGPT says, let's go through the problem step by step. I think this is the people who built ChatGPT figuring out how to detect logic puzzles and then getting the system to automatically do it. Might not be the case, but it didn't use to do this, so... And they are messing with the system all the time but it's kind of doing that step for us. And it does produce an output, and in this case, it did produce the correct output, though it doesn't always do, so you have to know what the correct output is. But let's see what happens if I tell it to take a deep breath too. So in the exercise files here, you'll find the prompt. It's the same logic puzzle as before. Although now we say, take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step. Run this and now it says, let's work through the problem step by step and it goes through a very rigorous step-by-step process. And if you experiment with this, what you'll notice is if you prefix your request by take a deep breath, it goes through a more in-depth process every time. And it's more likely to produce the correct output if you give it a challenging question like a logic puzzle. So why is this happening? Well, think about the training material that underpins all of these large language models. It's the content on the internet. And if you go on the internet, you'll find tons of information about how to solve complex problems by first taking a deep breath and then going step by step. So when we tell the system to take a deep breath and go step by step, we are invoking patterns in the training material that are very detailed breakdowns of a problem into discreet steps that can be solved, one after the other until the task is solved. So anytime you ask an LLM system, how do I open a door with a broken key in it or pull a cork out of a bottle where the cork broke or do something else and you tell it, take a deep breath and go step by step. It'll give you a far more detailed breakdown with discrete steps every time because it's matching the patterns associated with that language. Like I said in the intro, some prompt engineering feels almost more like AI alchemy and this is one example.


Here are the key takeaways from the video "Take a deep breath and work step by step":

Step-by-step approach: Instructing an AI to solve problems step-by-step improves its accuracy and output quality.
"Take a deep breath": Adding this phrase to prompts encourages the AI to provide more detailed and thorough responses.
Training data influence: The effectiveness of these techniques is due to the patterns in the AI's training data, which often include detailed, step-by-step problem-solving methods.

These strategies help enhance the AI's performance in generating accurate and detailed responses.
