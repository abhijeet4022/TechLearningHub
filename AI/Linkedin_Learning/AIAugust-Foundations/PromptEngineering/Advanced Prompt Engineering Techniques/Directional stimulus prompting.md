- Some advanced prompt engineering techniques require specific prompts and specific strategies and can take time to set up. Others are really straightforward and seem almost like common sense once you see how they work. An example of this is what's called directional stimulus prompting, or in plain English, giving the AI a hint about what you want. Let me show you. So I have this article here about the nisse, is a mythical creature in Scandinavia. So I'm just going to grab a bunch of text here about this, like this, and then say copy and go into ChatGPT, paste it in, and then say at the bottom, give me a two to three sentence summary of the text above. So that's a straightforward instruction and ChatGPT should be able to give me what I'm asking for. So here I get a two to three sentence summary. Now if I look at all this information, it is coming from the original works because I am using the original work as reference and the system like we've seen before is very good at taking information out of that and summarizing it. However, in this case, I want the summary to include a specific piece of information, where this creature lives because I know that's a point of contention in Scandinavian folklore. To do that, I'll use directional stimulus prompting by giving the system a hint about what I want. This is what that prompt looks like. Summarize the above and two to three sentences based on the hint, and then we provide a hint. The hint then references something we already know exists within the article. I'll continue on here and say, summarize the above in two to three sentences based on the hint where the nisse lives. Send it off. Now because we've told the AI what piece of information from the original article we're actually looking for, it's able to put it into its summary. So here it says, in local tradition, the nisse doesn't reside at the North Pole, but is instead thought to live nearby in a forest, in Greenland, in the case of Denmark or in Lapland for Finland, maintaining a distinct connection of each culture's geography. So where the original summary was just a general summary, when we used directional stimulus prompting, AKA, a hint, we got a summary that points out the key features we are looking for. So this means anytime you're asking for a summary and you know the specific pieces of the original article you want to be highlighted, you just literally stipulate it in your request for the summary, and that's what the system will do. This is advanced prompt engineering, and when you look at it, it makes common sense because this is what you would do if you talk to a person. And in many cases working with AIs is just like working with a real person.

Here are the key takeaways from the "Directional stimulus prompting" video:

Hint-based prompting: Directional stimulus prompting involves giving the AI a specific hint about what you want included in its response.
Targeted summaries: By providing a hint, such as a specific piece of information to include, the AI can generate more focused and relevant summaries.
Practical application: This technique is useful when you need the AI to highlight particular details from a larger body of text, making it more effective in extracting and summarizing key information.

These points illustrate how directional stimulus prompting can enhance the precision and relevance of AI-generated responses.
