Q. You are developing an AI system to solve math problems for a tutoring app. You notice that the AI produces inconsistent results when solving similar problems. How can you improve the consistency of the AI's solutions?
A. Use chain-of-thought prompting with zero-shot examples. Using chain-of-thought prompting with zero-shot examples instructs the AI to think step-by-step through problems, improving the consistency and accuracy of its solutions.

Q. A language model (LM) is faced with a complex logic puzzle where it must calculate the number of people left on a bus after several stops with passengers getting on and off. The initial prompt simply asks for the solution, while an enhanced prompt additionally advises the model to take a deep breath and solve the problem step by step. Why might the enhanced prompt lead to a more accurate and detailed response from the LM?
A. The enhanced prompt leverages patterns from the internet that detail step-by-step problem-solving, leading to a more meticulous approach by the LM. By prompting the LM to take a deep breath and solve step-by-step, it triggers the model to follow detailed problem-solving patterns commonly found in the training data, leading to a more accurate breakdown of the task

Q. A company wants to generate multiple examples of customer reviews categorized by sentiment to train an AI model for sentiment analysis. Which approach would be most effective in achieving this?
A. Use generated knowledge prompting to create multiple examples of customer reviews categorized by sentiment. Generated knowledge prompting allows an AI model to create numerous examples based on initial structured input, making the process efficient and scalable.

Q. You are tasked with creating a complex data analysis model for predicting market trends. To ensure the most accurate results, you decide to use an AI system based on the Tree-of-Thought method. Which of the following explains the core advantage of using this method over traditional linear thinking approaches?
A. It leverages multiple expert opinions in parallel and selects the best steps to form an optimal solution. The Tree-of-Thought method allows the AI system to utilize multiple experts who independently contribute to solving each step. This parallel processing enables the system to compare different approaches and choose the best path at each step.

Q. You are using a language model to summarize an article about a historical event. You need the summary to emphasize the event's impact on modern society. Which prompt engineering technique should you use to ensure that the summary highlights this specific aspect?
A. Directional stimulus prompting involves specifying exactly what part of the content you want the model to emphasize, ensuring the summary includes the desired detail.

Q. When using an AI language model like ChatGPT, which strategy is most effective in ensuring you receive specific and accurate information?
A. Provide the AI with a detailed context or reference material before asking your question.  Providing the AI with detailed context or reference material allows the model to pull directly from the provided information, increasing the accuracy and specificity of the response.

Q. You are developing an AI chatbot for a pizza restaurant. You want the chatbot to always include the restaurant's name in its responses and maintain a consistent tone that mirrors the brand's voice. Which technique should you use to ensure this consistency?
A. Few-shot prompting involves providing several examples of the desired pattern to the AI. By showing the system repeated examples that include the restaurants name and the tone of the responses, the AI will learn to replicate this pattern in its replies.
