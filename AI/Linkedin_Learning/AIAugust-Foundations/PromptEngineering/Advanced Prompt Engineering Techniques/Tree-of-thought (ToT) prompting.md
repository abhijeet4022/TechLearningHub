- So far, all the advanced prompt engineering techniques I've shown you represent linear thinking of some sort. You go through a set of steps from the beginning to an answer. But AI systems can also do a type of thinking that we really can't. And Tree-of-Thought provides one good example of this. So imagine, you have a task and instead of trying to solve it yourself, you go out and find a series of experts and you ask them all for each step in the task, what is the best way to move forward? And then they all respond to you in turn with each of the steps. And then you pick which of the steps is the best one, and you follow that path to a solution. You can actually get an AI system to do this automatically, and this is done much faster than how a human would do it. So, you're basically leveraging the ability of the system to come up with multiple different solutions to your problem, and then having the system pick which solution it thinks is the best one. And all of this can be done with one single prompt. Let me show you. In the Tree-of-Thought example in the exercise files, you'll see it says, "Imagine three different experts "are answering this question. "All experts will write down one step of their thinking, "then share it with the group. "Then all the experts will go on "to the next step, et cetera. "If any experts realizes they're wrong "at any point, they leave." And then we provide the question. So I'll copy this and go in and paste it into ChatGPT form and see what happens. So, what we're asking the system to do here is first create three experts, then break down the number of steps necessary to solve this particular challenge. And then for each step, have the experts say what is the task in the current step? And then finally, have the system figure out how to string the best of each of the steps together to solve the problem. What we get in return is something really fascinating. Here, you see ChatGPT reason itself through this task, through three different imagined mathematicians. And for each step we first have the step itself where each of the mathematicians comes up with a task, and then we have a sharing step where each of the mathematicians shares this task with the other mathematicians and compares its results. And when we scroll down, the system was able to figure out, hey, one of these solutions isn't actually a good solution, so abandon this one. Then at the bottom we get the conclusions where we get Mathematician A's conclusion, which is 72 passengers, Mathematician B's conclusion, which is also 72 passengers. And the fact that Mathematician C has left the conversation and the bottom conclusion is then 72, which is the correct answer. So, if you have a complex task, you want ChatGPT to solve, you can use this prompt to get ChatGPT to generate multiple different experts to reason their way through the solution. And you get multiple different responses and the system will then say, "The majority answer is...," rather than just give you one answer. This is really useful anytime you're trying to get the system to solve a complex task. Because as you know, through experimentation, the system will not always give you the correct answer once. But if you run it multiple times, you can then correlate all the answers. And this is a way of getting the system to do all of that with a single prompt.


Here are the key takeaways from the "Tree-of-thought (ToT) prompting" video:

Non-linear thinking: Unlike linear prompting techniques, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting allows AI to explore multiple potential solutions simultaneously and choose the best path forward.
Expert simulation: The AI creates multiple "experts" to tackle each step of a task, compares their solutions, and selects the most effective one.
Efficiency: This method leverages the AI's ability to quickly generate and evaluate multiple solutions, making it ideal for solving complex tasks with a single prompt.

These points highlight how ToT prompting enhances the AI's problem-solving capabilities by simulating diverse expert opinions and selecting the optimal solution.
