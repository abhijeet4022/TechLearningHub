## Key takeaways for this course
This course on "Prompt Engineering: How to Talk to the AIs" covers several important concepts. Here are the key takeaways:

Core Concepts of Generative AI: Understand the basics of generative AI and its impact on various fields.
Prompt Engineering: Learn the elements of a basic prompt, including instructions, questions, input data, and examples, and explore more advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.
Practical Examples: Review examples of prompts for both image generation and large-language models (LLMs), and learn advanced prompts that can transform business operations.

By the end of the course, you'll have a solid foundation in prompt engineering and be equipped with practical tips and tricks to effectively communicate with AI systems.

If you're here, you probably have already heard about ChatGPT and GPT-4, and might have even come across the term prompt engineering in that context. Is prompt engineering something you should care about? Is it relevant to you and your current role? Let me answer that with a personal story. Before I joined LinkedIn to lead generative AI efforts, I co-founded a startup in the AI for healthcare space. We were at the forefront of using the state-of-the-art AI models in a high stakes domain like healthcare. At some point, it became clear that in order to make things work, the medical doctors in our team needed to be very involved in designing the interface with the AI. So we had to have medical doctors become involved in doing prompt engineering. Think about it. If medical doctors in the future will need to understand how to interact with the AI, chances are you will too. In this course, I will give you a gentle introduction on how to talk to the AI. As you will see shortly, most of it boils down to how to follow good prompt engineering practices.
