## Key takeaways for this video
Here are the key takeaways from the video "Apply the STEP framework for lasting AI ROI":

Segmentation: Break down jobs into tasks and assign the right level of AI involvement based on risk, value, and predictability. This helps in creating clarity and matching AI to real business value.
Transition: Redefine roles and support skill development to help employees transition successfully as AI changes the way tasks are performed.
Education: Continuous learning is essential. Build a culture where learning is part of the workflow to keep up with evolving AI tools and technologies.
Performance: Update how performance is defined and rewarded to reflect new forms of contribution enabled by AI, such as judgment and collaboration with AI.

These steps help ensure AI becomes a strategic advantage and delivers lasting ROI.

- By now, you've seen how AI can reshape tasks, redefine roles, and create powerful opportunities to work smarter. But it's also clear that getting lasting ROI from AI isn't just about choosing the right tool, it's about managing the changes that come with it. So here's a way to remember the leadership moves that make AI stick, it's called the STEP Framework. You've already seen each of these ideas throughout this course. STEP simply gives you a structure to carry them forward and apply them in your own organization. Let's walk through it. S is for segmentation. You've learned that not every task should be handled the same way. Some are great candidates for automation, others benefit from augmentation or delegation. The key is breaking jobs down into tasks and assigning the right level of AI involvement based on risk, value, and predictability. When you segment thoughtfully, you create clarity. AI becomes a partner instead of a black box. The leadership takeaway: Don't automate jobs - analyze tasks. That's how you match AI to real business value. T is for transition. When tasks change, roles change too. You've seen how AI opens the door to higher value work, but that door doesn't open by itself. People can't grow into new responsibilities unless leaders make space for it. Redefining roles, re-scoping expectations, and supporting skill development are part of helping employees transition successfully. This is how you turn time saved into insight gained, and burnout into momentum. The leadership takeaway: When AI changes the way you work, you need to change the role. Make that evolution intentional. E is for education. AI tools evolve fast. That means continuous learning isn't optional, it's core to success. We've looked at how companies support technical upskilling and deeper domain expertise, whether it's bootcamps, certifications, peer-led learning circles, or time carved out for online exploration, the organizations that thrive with AI are the ones where learning is built into the culture, not just a one-time training event, but a sustained commitment to growing with the technology. The leadership takeaway: Build a culture where learning is part of the workflow, not something people squeeze in around it. P is for performance. Finally, we explored how AI shifts the definition of what good work looks like. When machines take on more of the routine, you can't keep measuring productivity the way you used to. You have to recognize new forms of contribution, like judgment, pattern recognition, and collaboration with the AI itself. That may mean adjusting metrics, evaluation tools, or even how roles are publicly valued across the organization. Leadership takeaway: If you want people to embrace AI, show them how it counts. Update how performance is defined and rewarded. So when you think about how to drive lasting ROI from AI, don't just think about implementation, think about STEP, segment the work, support the transition, embed education, and evolve performance. These are the levers that move AI from a promising tool to a strategic advantage, and they're your responsibility. You don't have to do it all at once, but if you commit to each part of STEP, you won't just have AI in your organization, you'll have an organization that's ready to see real ROI from AI.
