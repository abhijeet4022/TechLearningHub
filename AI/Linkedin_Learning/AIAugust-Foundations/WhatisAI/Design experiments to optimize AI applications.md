Here are the key takeaways from the video "Design experiments to optimize AI applications":

* Experimentation is crucial: Since generative AI evolves rapidly, experimentation helps determine its current capabilities and how it can be effectively used in your organization.
* Set clear learning objectives: Focus on learning how accurate, relevant, and usable AI-generated outputs are under real working conditions, rather than just hoping for specific outcomes.
* Define the job to be done: Clearly outline the specific tasks AI needs to perform, making them concrete, measurable, and tied to actual workflows.
* Design and evaluate experiments: Conduct small tests, track key metrics, and set success thresholds to determine when AI is effective. Adjust based on findings to optimize AI applications.

These steps help ensure AI is integrated responsibly and effectively, providing real business value.

- As you've noticed, there's no user manual for generative AI. There's no guide that tells you exactly what it can do or what it can't or how it's going to behave in your specific context. And even if there were, it would be outdated tomorrow. That's because Gen AI doesn't sit still, it adapts, it evolves, and the way it performs today is not the way it's going to perform next quarter. That's why experimentation is required. It's how your organization figures out what AI is good for right now for your people and your work. Done right, experimentation doesn't just test tools, it builds the habits and insight you need to scale AI responsibly and effectively. Let's walk through an example. Imagine a global consulting firm that wants to experiment with AI to help consultants draft client proposals faster. First, they set a learning objective, not something like, "We hope AI writes proposals faster," but "We want to learn how accurate, relevant, and usable AI generated proposals are." First, they set a learning objective, not something like, "We hope AI writes proposals faster," but "We want to learn how accurate, relevant, and usable AI generated proposals are under real working conditions." A learning objective is about uncertainty. It frames the specific questions you're trying to answer, not the outcomes you hope for. Next, they define the job to be done. This is different. A job to be done is about what real world task the AI needs to perform to be valuable. In this case, they might say, "Draft a first pass proposal outline based on client meeting notes within two hours." A good job to be done is concrete, measurable, and tied to an actual workflow, not just a vague goal, like "improve productivity." With that foundation, the firm designs a small test. A few teams use AI to draft proposal outlines over two weeks. They track key metrics like how much time AI saves compared to writing from scratch, how much editing is needed to make drafts client-ready, and how often consultants actually choose to refuse the AI generated suggestions. Instead of just asking, "Does it work?", they test variations, different prompt styles, different types of projects, even different teams to see when AI works best. They also set clear success thresholds. For example, AI must cut drafting time by 30% and require no more than 20% manual revision to be considered a viable tool. Early tests miss the mark. Drafts need too much rework, but after they adjust how they feed client notes into the system, they hit both targets within a month. Here's the deeper leadership insight. AI adoption isn't just about moving fast and breaking things anymore. It's about moving smart and learning faster than your competitors. In the age of AI, the real advantage belongs to the fastest learners, not the smartest movers. Here's the deeper leadership insight. AI adoption isn't about moving fast and breaking things anymore.
