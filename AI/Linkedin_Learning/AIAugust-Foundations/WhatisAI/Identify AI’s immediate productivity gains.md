1. Manual tasks that scale poorly
2. Knowledge work slowed down by search
3. Expert time



Focus on Manual Tasks: Look for tasks that take a lot of time as your business grows, like data entry or writing follow-up emails. AI can help by automating these tasks, saving time and allowing employees to focus on more important work.

Improve Search Efficiency: Think about how much time is spent searching for information. AI can quickly find the right documents or information, making it easier and faster for employees to get what they need.

Free Up Expert Time: AI can handle initial, time-consuming work like summarizing long documents. This allows experts to spend more time on high-value tasks that require their expertise.


The key is to identify where time is being wasted and use AI to streamline those areas, allowing your team to focus on tasks that require human skills like decision-making and creativity.
