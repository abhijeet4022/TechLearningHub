## Data Analytics
To read the data from any DB and from any data source and manipulate these data to get the desired/required output/Ans.  
Also, we can say to get the insight of the data.

## Data Scientist
- DA looks for current data and finds the insight, whereas DS goes beyond the current data and starts predicting the data.
- **Example:** Weather Prediction App (ML/DS)
    - Like prediction: what is the possible score can be for his team (this is ML prediction).

- DA is **Descriptive** and DS is **Predictive**, where DS is doing from historical data (**Past Data**).

### Algorithms that will help to predict:
- KNN
- LR

# GenAI
**Generative + Interactive + Autonomous**
- Generative: Predict the next word.
- Interactive: Learning from feedback, like it shows options from GPT and when you choose one, it will answer from that side.
- Autonomous: Independent AI Agent.

# Agentic AI
**Model Building + Memory + Tools used + Goals**
- Model Building: LLM
- Memory: Store Previous Context
- Goals: We want an Agent to think, observe, learn and act.
- Tools: Use tools to achieve the goal.
